    feedback: "Excellent work! 🌟 Let's understand why this matters:\n\n🔐 In real life, weak passwords like 'password123' can be guessed in seconds by hackers. For example, if someone used this password for their email, a hacker could:\n- Read their private messages\n- Reset passwords for other accounts\n- Send fake emails to their friends\n\n💪 Strong passwords like 'C@t&D0g!' are much safer because:\n- Special characters (@, &, !) make it harder to guess\n- Mixed case letters add complexity\n- It's not a common word or phrase",
